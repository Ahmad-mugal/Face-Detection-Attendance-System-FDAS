# FDAS Development Journey

## Phase 1 - Static React Frontend Shell

### Goal
Build the static React frontend shell from the Stitch screens using dummy data only. Phase 1 intentionally does not include backend APIs, database persistence, real authentication logic, or face recognition.

### Files Created Or Modified
- `frontend/src/components/CameraFrameUpload.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/FilterBar.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminStudents.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminAddStudent.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminLiveAttendance.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminAnalytics.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminRequests.jsx`

### Existing Components Used
- `StatsCard`
- `StudentTable`
- `FilterBar`
- `AttendanceChart`
- `AttendanceLogSidebar`
- `CameraEnrollment`
- `CameraFrameUpload`
- `CSVExportButton`

### Pages Created
- `/admin/dashboard`
- `/admin/students`
- `/admin/students/add`
- `/admin/attendance/live`
- `/admin/analytics`
- `/admin/requests`
- `/admin/users`
- `/admin/classes`
- `/admin/timing`
- `/user/dashboard`
- `/user/students`
- `/user/students/add`
- `/user/attendance`
- `/user/reports`

### Tests And Build Commands Run
- `npm run build` - blocked by Windows PowerShell execution policy for `npm.ps1`.
- `npm.cmd run build` - passed. Vite build completed successfully with a non-blocking chunk-size warning.
- `cmd /c npm run build` - passed. This verifies the requested npm build script directly through the Windows command shell.
- `npm.cmd run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173` - Vite dev server reached ready state at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`; command timed out because the dev server keeps running.
- `cmd /c npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173` - Vite dev server reached ready state at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`; command timed out because the dev server keeps running.
- `npm.cmd run lint` - passed with no warnings after cleanup.

### Errors Found And Fixed
- The router imported admin and user page modules that did not exist yet, which would cause a blank screen/build failure. Added all required static page modules.
- `docs/development_journey.md` did not exist. Created it for Phase 1 tracking.
- PowerShell blocked `npm run build` through `npm.ps1`; verified the same scripts successfully with `npm.cmd`.
- Existing lint warnings in shared Phase 1 components were fixed by rendering `FilterBar` actions directly and making `CameraFrameUpload` use its `isActive` prop.

### Remaining Issues
- Vite reports a non-blocking production chunk-size warning because the frontend bundle includes charting/router/UI dependencies. This does not prevent Phase 1 from running or building.

## Phase 1.1 - UI QA and Static Interaction Polish

### Issues Fixed
- Removed/avoided broken recognition watermark-style text on admin and user shells by keeping navigation labels clean and explicit.
- Tightened global body/root overflow behavior and added reusable page/table wrappers to prevent unwanted left-right page scrolling.
- Completed Admin Add Student and User Add Student static forms with all required profile fields and face enrollment sections.
- Replaced real camera enrollment behavior with a static dummy 3-sample enrollment preview suitable for Phase 1.1.
- Improved admin setup pages for Pending User Requests, Manage Users, Manage Classes, and Attendance Timing with clearer tables/cards and dummy action flows.
- Improved User Attendance with assigned department, attendance window, session status, Start/Stop Attendance, camera placeholder, liveness text, marked-students log, and duplicate/liveness dummy messages.
- Improved Reports and Analytics pages with visible filters, stable chart containers, export buttons, and wrapped tables.

- Logout buttons route back to `/login`.
- Admin and operator notification buttons open small dummy dropdowns.
- Admin and operator profile/avatar buttons open dummy profile menus.
- Admin Settings dropdown links to Manage Users, Manage Classes, Attendance Timing, and Pending Requests.
- Add Student buttons route to their respective add-student pages.
- Export CSV keeps client-side dummy CSV download behavior.
- Pending request Approve/Reject buttons update dummy request status through a confirmation modal.
- Manage Users supports Change Access modal, Grant All Departments, and Enable/Disable dummy state.
- Manage Classes supports Add/Edit modal and Archive/Restore dummy state.
- Attendance Timing supports Add/Edit modal and Activate/Deactivate dummy state.
- Admin live attendance supports Start/Stop Attendance and static Start/Stop Attendance controls.
- User attendance supports Start/Stop Attendance plus dummy duplicate and liveness messages.
- Student Edit/Archive buttons open placeholder confirmation modals.

### Build/Lint Results
- `npm.cmd run build` - passed. Vite completed production build with a non-blocking chunk-size warning.
- `npm.cmd run lint` - passed with no warnings.

### Remaining Issues
- All data remains dummy/static by design.
- No backend, database, real authentication, backend upload, or real face recognition is implemented in Phase 1.1.

### Follow-up Layout Fix
- Fixed the Admin top header overflow by compacting nav spacing, keeping header items non-wrapping, and moving Logout into the profile dropdown.
- Replaced the `face_recognition` Material Symbols ligature in Admin and User navigation with a normal attendance icon so broken `_RØGNITION Attendance` text cannot appear.
- Replaced remaining visible Recognition wording in the static frontend with Attendance wording where it affected Phase 1.1 UI polish.
- Verified with `rg` that `_RØGNITION`, `RØGNITION`, `RECOGNITION Attendance`, `Recognition Attendance`, `face_recognition`, and `Recognition` no longer appear in `frontend/src`.
- `npm.cmd run build` - passed with the existing non-blocking Vite chunk-size warning.
- `npm.cmd run lint` - passed with no warnings.

### Camera and Dropdown Interaction Fix
- Restored browser camera preview for Admin Live Attendance and User Attendance using `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`.
- Added camera track cleanup when attendance is stopped, when the shared camera is deactivated, and when attendance pages/components unmount.
- Added friendly camera permission-denied messages while keeping recognition and liveness behavior dummy-only.
- Updated Admin dropdown behavior so Settings, notifications, and profile menus are mutually exclusive and close on outside click, Escape, and route navigation.
- Updated User top-bar dropdown behavior so notifications/profile close on outside click, Escape, route navigation, and the Settings icon.
- Kept Admin Logout inside the profile menu and kept Attendance nav labels/icons clean.
- `npm.cmd run build` - passed with the existing non-blocking Vite chunk-size warning.
- `npm.cmd run lint` - passed with no warnings.

### Attendance Control Cleanup
- Removed duplicate Start/Stop Attendance buttons from the Admin Live Attendance camera card header.
- Kept a single top-right Start/Stop Attendance toggle on Admin Live Attendance and User Attendance.
- Camera/card headers now show status badges only: Session Active, Session Inactive, and Camera Active only when the video stream is active.
- The single page-level control starts the live camera preview and stops camera tracks when attendance is stopped.
- `npm.cmd run build` - passed with the existing non-blocking Vite chunk-size warning.
- `npm.cmd run lint` - passed with no warnings.

### Active Attendance Navigation Confirmation
- Added a frontend-only attendance session context shared by Admin Live Attendance, User Attendance, AdminLayout, and UserLayout.
- Attendance pages now mark the shared session active when Start Attendance is clicked and clear it when Stop Attendance is clicked or camera permission is denied.
- Active camera stop callbacks are registered with the shared context so confirmed navigation stops camera tracks before leaving.
- Admin top navigation, Admin settings links, Admin profile logout, User sidebar links, and User logout now show the confirmation message before navigating away from an active attendance page.
- Cancel keeps the user on the same attendance page and leaves the camera/session active.
- Confirm/OK stops the registered camera/session cleanup, marks attendance inactive, and then allows navigation.
- Added `beforeunload` protection for browser refresh/close while attendance is active.
- `npm.cmd run build` - passed with the existing non-blocking Vite chunk-size warning.
- `npm.cmd run lint` - passed with no warnings.

### User Sidebar Active Route Fix
- Updated UserLayout sidebar active-state logic to use exact pathname matching.
- Fixed `/user/students` and `/user/students/add` so only Students or Add Student is highlighted, never both.
- Kept active attendance navigation confirmation behavior on all User sidebar links and Logout.
- `npm.cmd run build` - passed with the existing non-blocking Vite chunk-size warning.
- `npm.cmd run lint` - passed with no warnings.
